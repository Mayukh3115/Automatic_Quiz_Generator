## ⚠️ Important Note About Data Persistence

This project uses a **temporary database setup**.

This means:

* User accounts may not persist permanently
* You may need to sign up again after some time
* This behavior is expected and intentional

The application is intended to demonstrate functionality rather than long-term data storage.

## 🔐 Authentication

* Users can sign up and log in securely
* Sessions remain active during usage
* Logging out ends the session
